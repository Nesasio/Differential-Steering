# Differential Steering System
This repository contains the implementation of differential steering system for robotic projects using Arduino microcontroller. The system was developed for a battle robot for RoboWars competition.
The bot was inspired from [Carbide from BattleBots](https://robotwars.fandom.com/wiki/Carbide).

## Components
The components used to build the robot were:
| S.No. | Component |
