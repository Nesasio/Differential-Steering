# Differential Steering System
This repository contains the implementation of differential steering system for robotic projects using Arduino microcontroller. The system was developed for a battle robot for RoboWars competition.
The bot was inspired from [Carbide from BattleBots](https://robotwars.fandom.com/wiki/Carbide).

## Components
The major components used to build the robot were:
| S.No. | Component                                |
| :---- | :--------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Arduino Uno                              |
| 2     | L298n Motor Driver                       |
| 3     | Relay Module for Weapon Control          |
| 4     | Lithium Polymer 8000mAh 12 Volts Battery |
| 5     | Flysky CT6B Controller and Receiver      |
| 6     | High Power 12 Volts Motors               |

## Robot Design
The design of the robot was made in [DS Solidworks](https://www.solidworks.com/).
The basic design of prototype is shown:
